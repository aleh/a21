/** 
 * Allows to use a EC11 with a single pin. Handy when you are out of pins but can afford to do ADC fequently enough.
 *
 * The setup uses 3 resistors here: all are connected to your ADC pin with their one end and to Vcc, pin A and pin B 
 * of your encoder with their other ends. Their resistances are passed here as R, RA, and RB correspondingly.
 * The max resolution of your ADC is passed here as well (V00). Note that RA should be greater than RB. 
 * The default values are optimized for low current draw and maximum difference in ADC values.
 *
 * Working with this class is very similar to working with EC11: you do ADC on your pin fast enough 
 * and call checkValue() instead of checkPins(). You can then call read() less freqiently from your interrupt-enabled 
 * loop to check if any event was recorded.
